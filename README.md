# Employees Management System
A java based project that performs all the managing operations to track Employees' records. This project incorporates layered programming.

*The source has two Data Layers. This is because, in the layer('db', the first and naive) no Database is used. Rercords where stored using File Handling. This layer is redundant and is deprecated later.*
